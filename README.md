### 📌 About the Project

**Scholar Pay** is a secure and smart UPI-based application that helps students **utilize their scholarship money** **only on verified and official platforms** — such as education fees, coaching, learning tools, or government-registered services.

Inspired by apps like **PhonePe** and **Google Pay**, but built exclusively for the student community to:
- Promote financial discipline,
- Ensure proper fund usage, and
- Prevent misuse of scholarship benefits.
